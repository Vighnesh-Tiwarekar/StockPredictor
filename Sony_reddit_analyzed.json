    "comment": "> I just don’t understand why Netflix is trading over $1000 a share and stocks like WBD or DIS are much cheaper.  PARA is up about 21% since going public.... in 1990. That is not a good record and if you look at the long-term record of Warner all the way back before the spin to the original IPO, it's not good either. Smaller pure play media cos (LGF.A, AMCX) have been obliterated since they went public.   You had a business that was entirely hit driven and very cyclical. Now you have a business where the cable channels - which used to be at least a decent business - have become melting ice cubes and have either been spun off (Comcast, where they only kept Bravo) or have resulted in billions of dollars of write-downs.   Last year: \"During their second quarter earnings report on August 7, Warner Bros. Discovery announced an $11.2 billion including a $9.1 billion write-down for their linear cable TV networks. Besides the struggling linear cable networks, WBD cited the potential of losing the NBA as another reason. The WBD also reported a $2.1 billion of “pre-tax acquisition-related amortization of intangibles, content fair value step-up, and restructuring expenses” (https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2024/08/09/as-linear-tv-loses-revenue-wbd-takes-a--91-billion-write-down/)  So you have a media business that used to make a lot of money on network/cable channels and those audiences have eroded away. In terms of movies, it seems like every movie costs $150-200M now, so that much more difficult to actually make money.   Every one of these companies thought they could be Netflix but they can't, so you have all these companies with their streaming services (Paramount+, Max, etc) that are not the businesses they wanted them to be so they are now thinking more about licensing to Netflix. Well, if you're licensing the good stuff to Netflix, that's taking offerings away from the streaming service that already isn't the business you'd hoped.  There is value in the vaults but 1) I don't think it's as much as people think it is and 2) having a CEO like Zaslav isn't doing anything for the value of the IP. Zaslav is absolutely one of the most overpaid CEOs in the country. It's extraordinary what WBD pays him and what PARA paid both Bakish and the three co-CEOs that came after him.   The thing that isn't talked about as much surprisingly, is Apple and Amazon. Apple is losing a billion dollars a year on Apple TV (https://www.theverge.com/news/633591/apple-tv-plus-losing-1-billion), but if you're Apple and you're a giant tech company making a shit ton of money elsewhere, a billion dollar loss on TV is largely ignored. If you're a pure play media company and that's the whole business, losses are not nearly as well tolerated. Apple and Amazon's ability to overpay for talent and material also winds up raising prices for companies like WBD.   So, yes, maybe there is a point where these names get cheap enough that there isn't much downside but the continued interest in these names on here in terms of the businesses themselves I don't get at all.",

I know it’s a revenue stream when they make the content for others but it doesn’t seem like a good longterm strategy for WBD.

From the Sony earnings report:  >PS Plus is providing a stable base of earnings as sales on a U.S. dollar basis increased 18% year-on-year. This is due to an increase in ARPU (average revenue per user)primarily resulting from a shift to higher tiers of service and the impact of price revisions.  This is with the PS5 sales (65.5 million)slightly lagging PS4 sales during the same time period by roughly 2.2 million units.

Byron Allen offered $21.53 per class B share, The Apollo/Sony Offer was $26 Billion, or about $20 per share after debt is paid off, and the most recent Skydance offer was a $15 per share tender offer on about 50% of the shares. So the stock has hovered between $10 and $15 based on various leaks to the media about offers, negotiations, etc.  With many offers shot down by Shari Redstone, the most recent one being the Skydance offer, optimism for a deal is at record lows.  What also isn't helping is nearly every media outlet is releasing articles implying that the company is on the brink of collapse, even though the company's financials paint a completely different picture.  There is reason for optimism- Legacy TV, while it is slowly declining(about 1% YoY decline in subscription/affiliate revenue, and a cyclical downturn in advertising), it is still producing over $4.5 Billion in operating income per year, while the company's market cap is just $6.3 Billion. Direct To consumer, despite its tremendous growth, has been a money pit for the past 3 years, which is why the stock has tanked so hard, but is on track to become domestically profitable by 2025.  The stock isn't going to be the next Nvidia, the next Apple, etc. But it is a deep value play- with the actions they're taking to cut costs, aim for cashflow/profitability, and deleverage, I think the stock can easily double in the next 3 years and triple in 5 years.",

Rather than profiting off of licensing their shows to streaming services, they instead poured Billions into their own streaming service. So basically, for 5 years Paramount blew most of its cash flow on this streaming service that still hasn't attained profitability. Not only did it blow its cash flow, but it had to sell off some of its valuable real estate and lease it back just to fund this ambition.  - Paramount has multiple potential buyers willing to pay twice the current market price of the stock, but she keeps saying no.  - With the stock trading incredibly cheap relative to nearly every metric, and TV media still generating over $4 Billion in annual operating income, she has not pushed for stock buybacks.   - She rejected a $11 Billion offer for Paramount's film studio, even though the filmed entertainment division is a small portion of revenues, and usually unprofitable. The proceeds for this could've paid off most of the company's $14 Billion in debt, and bought back a huge portion of the $6.3 Billion in shares outstanding.  The best thing that could happen to Paramount would be her selling her NAI stake to someone more competent. Paramount is worth at least $20 a share, but the uncertainty associated with her mismanagement is what's keeping the price so low.  The only reason I'm bullish is because it's very clear that she's done trying to blow money on Streaming, and the company is actually focused on efficiency and cash flow now. There were a few misteps(why shut down Noggin instead of selling, why remove shows in the showtime merger and take content impairments?), but overall I think it's positive for shareholders.",

If you are concerned about where it will be in 2 weeks, I would not recommend buying.  Momentum is working very hard against Paramount:  1. It's one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the S&P500 by percentage of float. With the threat of mergers fading, short sellers have been empowered to short sell like crazy.  2. Due to its low market cap, the stock could be removed from the S&P500, which could put further downwards pressure on price as indexes need to sell it off.  3. I think for the stock to reverse its long term trend, without a merger/ major asset sale, the company needs to report strong earnings with solid cash flows, and make progress on its balance sheet. Paramount's next earnings call isn't until August 5, and even then, I think it will take longer than that for them to really start fixing their cash flow.  It would not surprise me if in a week short sellers bring this stock down to $9. It's just where momentum is going. But I don't buy stuff based on momentum, I buy it based on value.

So if you are able to wait a year through a M&A process, if it closes, new shareholders could make a solid return. That being said, it still seems like a breach of fiduciary duty considering there were better offers, so I do think long term shareholders should sue.  I ended up selling at $11.71 because I didn't like management's decision making and the clear conflict of interest in their M&A activities. The day to day drama wasn't good for my health. I was hoping to make more profit, but I settled for a small profit. I've pretty much switched to index investing so I can focus on other things in life than keeping up with stocks.",

I own an Xbox and while that makes me a bit bias I think this was a really smart play by MS and it won't be as damaging to the industry as people say. By the time it would do anything I am sure there will be plenty of other things happening that will make this a non issue. Time will tell, though. Main point is, the fact that the articles are bringing up CoD and you brought up WoW means a lot of people really don't understand how much revenue MS just bought, it is really crazy and was absolutely worth the price. 70 billion is a huge number and it was heavily discounted",
