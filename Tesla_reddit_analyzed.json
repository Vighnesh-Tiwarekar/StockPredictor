Your insurance carrier has a legal duty to act in good faith when handling your claim. We all need to hold them to that standard, too, because they certainly aren’t doing us any favors when it comes to payouts and premiums. Bad faith claims are the only thing I’ve found in 15 years that actually scares insurance adjusters.  Tesla Insurance won’t even answer the phone when you need them, based on review after review that I’ve read. They leave their insureds high and dry, over and over, straight up refusing to even take their call. They have no business being in the insurance industry that way, no matter how cheap they may be.

You’ll notice that there have been minimal incentives by Tesla - only a small discount to interest rate.  What that basically says is that they didn’t have to sacrifice margin for sales so expect that earnings will be sequentially better.    Also, notice that there aren’t really any layoffs at the factories.  I think they got rid of some contractors.  The deliveries outpaced production so that basically depleted their supply.  What you’ll also find is that they will be able to offset any dip in production with just rolling out robotaxi’s - will be interesting to see how they actually account.    Expect also there to be some “hang over” because of the people that got their orders in before the end of the quarter/expiration of benefits so, expect September to be robust before a drop off.   The other thing that was interesting was the delivery of megapacks.  That’s also picking up speed - while there are competitors, there is enough demand out there to last all of the companies a fairly large order/delivery pipeline.

In a tentative ruling Monday, Santa Clara Superior Court Judge William Monahan declined Rivian’s request to throw out a misappropriation of trade secrets claim. Monahan agreed to dismiss Rivian’s intentional interference in contract claim, saying the trade secrets part covered that.   The judge also declined to dismiss Tesla’s claims against seven of its former employees, all of whom the carmaker accuses of divulging trade secrets when they went to work for the rival startup.   Tesla claimed in its lawsuit, filed in July, that Rivian had hired at least 178 of its former employees.   Rivian denies any wrongdoing and says Tesla’s lawsuit is an effort to kill competition in the electric car industry.   The case is Tesla Inc. v. Rivian Automotive Inc., 20CV368472, California Superior Court, Santa Clara County (San Jose).",

They will likely further increase until they sell through the tariffed inventory or eat an obsolescence charge. It will be harder to win customers and their inventory will be more expensive, so their operating and net incomes will tank even as their revenues increase.    Naturally, this will make the stock go up.",

I don't see the cost of these robots being able to compete effectively with labour for a long time. By then we are more likely to just grow an organic human body without a head in a lab. They will most likely replace humans in the most dangerous lines of work where safety compliance is very expensive. Why are we trying to make humanoid robots anyway?

In the short term, automating equipment built for specific tasks (cars, floor sweepers, forklifts, mining equipment, etc) is going to be more productive and profitable.  but the promise of humanoid robots is based on the idea that our entire world is designed around humans. Once you're able to build a humanoid robot that is dextrous and smart enough to be able to do basic manual tasks, then it immediately becomes incredibly versatile. Humanoid robots can interact with the machines we already have.  Take a fast food kitchen for instance. There are a bunch of machines designed for a specific task (freezer, mixer, fryer, dishwasher, register etc) and most of what fast food workers do is move things from one machine to another over and over. Once you build humanoid robots that can do basic tasks like open a freezer, remove food, close freezer, put food in fryer basket, etc. that is a huge amount of man hours in our economy.

Honestly automated forklifts probably offer a better ROI on warehouse work than humanoid robots do and that instead of trying to make a robot fit a warehouse that humans work in they should just redesign the warehouse to work with simple automated designs. Amazon already did a fantastic job with its floor robots to increase the efficiency of their human picker employees. They should just redesign the pick and place process to fit more standard automation designs instead of trying to get a robot to mimic human style dexterity. I imagine a ceiling mounted/gantry mounted arm with a camera and greater use of QR codes would be much more efficient at picking items from a shelf and putting them in boxes than a humanoid robot that needs to charge, have balancing software, and navigational software.

Meanwhile, total EV registrations in the region, which includes the UK and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), rose 26.8% in August, with overall registrations regardless of powertrain up 4.7%.”  So somehow the ACEA registrations - which is a proxy for sales data are down 22% and yet the total registrations in the region are up 26.8%??? This is fraud. I can’t prove it but for sales data and EV registrations to be off like this says that Tesla is registering unsold EVs. This wouldnt be the first time they have done something like this. They were already busted in Canada for doing a similar grift.  Frankly this is brazen beyond belief.

Arguably somewhat betting on the adoption of AI being rockier and more turbulent and less immediate ROIC than we might like to believe.  Institutions and CTA’s are pretty crowded into tech for good reason and aggressively long it. So is retail.  I also do like that the volume point of control from the april lows has shifted to the top 3rd of price action since april around the 570 level.  https://preview.redd.it/50ki8ed7z5qf1.jpeg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48cfb9615339052503a5b50978615e97ea041bd2  I will come back later with more data.",

They crawl up the wheel well, theres a big ass gap there, so easy for even something the size of a rabbit to get in there under the frunk. For some reason they always seem to chew that particular harness. I have had to get mine replaced last December, and it was $208, so $1400 seems crazy.",

Usually it's more common on ice vehicles because the wiring is more exposed and they are attracted to the smells of oils and coolant as well as motor warmth.  You will have to do a search on trapping or stopping rodents. lots of methods you can try. hopefully one works.",

Model y: 2023, more room, hw3 Model 3: 2025, less room, hw4  The model 3 would ideally have more range if they’re both the same trim as it’s a smaller car, has newer battery technology, and is more aerodynamic. But for driving uber the extra space might be nice for your passengers. Hw4 is also nice for the latest fsd and gives your car better resale as it’s not hw3, even if you’re not planning on using fsd the better cameras and more powerful infotainment system is better all around. This wouldn’t hold up if the m3 is standard range vs long range for the model y but overall the 3 would be the better resale car later on, the y would better the better passenger car. But in my opinion the 3 is roomy enough in the back as long as it’s not 3 adults.   Good luck 🫡",
