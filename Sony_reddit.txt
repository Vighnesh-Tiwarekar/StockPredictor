This is not that bad when you consider that it’s pre- Sinners and Minecraft breaking out. Everyone knew (or at least does now) that Mickey 17 was a colossal mistake. On the streaming side things are working out well for them and theatrically the Superman movie will most likely continue the upward trend. Might be a good time to buy imo.
Shares are up despite the EPS and Rev miss because subscriber growth was stellar and the call indicated they're expecting a strong Q2 at the box office.
I haven’t been to a theatre since Avatar 2. I don’t watch tv with ads and as a result have no idea what movies are be shown at any given time.
Did it do well when box office was great (Barbie making a billion+ in 2023?) Nope.   Pure play media names are not good businesses. People on this sub have continually tried to buy the dip on WBD all the way since the spin off from T. At some point perhaps they get cheap enough that there's not materially more downside, but I wouldn't be excited about the upside, either.
The subscriber numbers are rising but the revenues are declining. Does the cable business outweigh streaming in terms of profits?
Have you seen the superman trailer.   As a fan of Superman and DC, it is one film i will not see in theater or at home unless on intoxicated. What a huge disappointment.  It's as if they didn't need learn anything from Disney's Snow White film with over doing it wil social messaging.  That scene in the trailers with interaction between superman and the robots wasn't needed.  Also, the acting seemed terrible.
Hopefully the momentum continues. I just don’t understand why Netflix is trading over $1000 a share and stocks like WBD or DIS are much cheaper. I know Netflix has more subscribers but even so should they at least be half of what Netflix is trading
I’ve not been to a movie theater in years but I definitely would watch the movies when they are available on streaming.
They are growing internationally where the ARPU is lower. They arent just a US cable/streaming business. They are an international media expanding outside the US. They werent even in Australia as a standalone app until March 2025. Netflix and Disney have been in those countries for years.
Their stock conveniently shot up right after I posted this.
WBD has a TON more debt then Netflix, which is definitely weighting the stock down.   Long story short, Zaslav clearly overpaid for the WB assets from AT&T.
> I just don’t understand why Netflix is trading over $1000 a share and stocks like WBD or DIS are much cheaper.  PARA is up about 21% since going public.... in 1990. That is not a good record and if you look at the long-term record of Warner all the way back before the spin to the original IPO, it's not good either. Smaller pure play media cos (LGF.A, AMCX) have been obliterated since they went public.   You had a business that was entirely hit driven and very cyclical. Now you have a business where the cable channels - which used to be at least a decent business - have become melting ice cubes and have either been spun off (Comcast, where they only kept Bravo) or have resulted in billions of dollars of write-downs.   Last year: "During their second quarter earnings report on August 7, Warner Bros. Discovery announced an $11.2 billion including a $9.1 billion write-down for their linear cable TV networks. Besides the struggling linear cable networks, WBD cited the potential of losing the NBA as another reason. The WBD also reported a $2.1 billion of “pre-tax acquisition-related amortization of intangibles, content fair value step-up, and restructuring expenses” (https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2024/08/09/as-linear-tv-loses-revenue-wbd-takes-a--91-billion-write-down/)  So you have a media business that used to make a lot of money on network/cable channels and those audiences have eroded away. In terms of movies, it seems like every movie costs $150-200M now, so that much more difficult to actually make money.   Every one of these companies thought they could be Netflix but they can't, so you have all these companies with their streaming services (Paramount+, Max, etc) that are not the businesses they wanted them to be so they are now thinking more about licensing to Netflix. Well, if you're licensing the good stuff to Netflix, that's taking offerings away from the streaming service that already isn't the business you'd hoped.  There is value in the vaults but 1) I don't think it's as much as people think it is and 2) having a CEO like Zaslav isn't doing anything for the value of the IP. Zaslav is absolutely one of the most overpaid CEOs in the country. It's extraordinary what WBD pays him and what PARA paid both Bakish and the three co-CEOs that came after him.   The thing that isn't talked about as much surprisingly, is Apple and Amazon. Apple is losing a billion dollars a year on Apple TV (https://www.theverge.com/news/633591/apple-tv-plus-losing-1-billion), but if you're Apple and you're a giant tech company making a shit ton of money elsewhere, a billion dollar loss on TV is largely ignored. If you're a pure play media company and that's the whole business, losses are not nearly as well tolerated. Apple and Amazon's ability to overpay for talent and material also winds up raising prices for companies like WBD.   So, yes, maybe there is a point where these names get cheap enough that there isn't much downside but the continued interest in these names on here in terms of the businesses themselves I don't get at all.
This is a very good explanation of the difference between the streaming services mentioned.   I see your point on companies like WBD possibly driving potential customers away from themselves when making content for other streaming services such as Netflix. I know it’s a revenue stream when they make the content for others but it doesn’t seem like a good longterm strategy for WBD.   I enjoy the quality of WBD compared to other services but it doesn’t mean it’s the same for everyone else because it seems like they prefer quantity.
Someone call Warren Buffet and Jaime Dimon, this guy is onto something no one knows about
It’s been priced in for half a decade
Wow great idea no one has thought of this
Wait… there’s a new GTA coming out?! Good call jumping in before Wall Street finds out
$228? You basically bought this stock at an all time high. You're about 3 years late. This game was announced back in 2022, revealed Dec 2023, and you're investing now when the hype is at an all time high after their trailer release.    Also, earnings call in 9 days. Any negative sentiment will mean a drop in price. Any release date delay will mean you're bag holding past April 2026. That's money you could've invested elsewhere.
I think youre going to be disappointed to see that it’s not gonna do anything like you think it will
I like that you’re trying to think ahead. I don’t know how much it’ll move Sonys numbers (not saying it won’t, I just haven’t looked into that myself). I will say I had the idea to buy some ttwo a year and a half ago in anticipation of this. I feel like you might already have missed a lot of the run up.   Once gta 6 starts breaking records for number of games sold etc etc I think you’ll make some money, but don’t expect it to 2x from here
I did this for Nintendo growing up and it did work ever so slightly but look at it as a gateway to something else such as stocks who have big announcements like that 4 times a year and that’s called earnings my boy
ive been trying to get in since 2013 but i have been so broke i feel like ill never get rich off of this. ill need to hustle and hustle fast to get in while its this cheap. it wont ever be this cheap again.
IMO trailer 2 would have been the day to sell. That was today.
GTA VI?! I've never heard of it
I did that with RDR2 6 years ago.  It's not going to turn out like youre thinking, but maybe (like it did for me) will get you interested in investing.  My only suggestion would be to go All In or stay the fuck away, because it's not a pretty path if you don't do the work.  A better plan would be to leave the money in there for way longer than you are anticipating.  Take two is on my list right now because it's trending up, above it's 150 and 200 day moving averages, and the RSI is in a good spot.  If you aren't looking at indicators like that, then you're just gambling, and I can almost guarantee you will lose money.
Your thesis needs to be a little deeper.  What you’ve articulated so far is too obvious, it is almost certainly priced in.    Additionally, some of the basic premises aren’t as certain as you think they may be.  For example, what if it’s delayed again?  Just because they announced it’s a year away doesn’t make it certainly a year away.  Or what if it’s a flop?  Or just mediocre?  It’s unlikely but long, overly complex productions do sometimes end up stinking despite the hype.
I think this will pay. The question is ultimately - will the game disappoint or not, and I can't see a world with that happening.  The naysayers will reasonably say - is it priced in or not? They will use this to deter you of your investment. Fundamentals are important but the market doesn't so much behave like that. If you look at some of the most profitable investments in the past decade, their NAV or FCF to valuation would be embarrassing, yet shareholders were rewarded handsomely. They could have done any ""analysis"" they wanted, it wouldn't have been pretty. That's because the market today isn't the market 30, 40 years ago. Sometimes you just need to like a company and you'll be fine.
Good idea. Doing the same man.
A lot of you are forgetting stocks rise and fall with hype.... the hype is there among gamers... it's simmering right now. But once all the media jumps on the GTA6 bandwagon hype and people who don't game try to get in it'll for sure go up.. Sell it a couple days after release, before the mainstream media stops talking about. basically if your grandma is talking about it you should already be in and ready to sell. Price today is $263. I'll check in later.
Wrong.
I feel the same way, I'm not expecting some crazy 2x-3x returns here just a decent profit by timing part of the run up and holding smaller pieces through the launch and honestly that's all I expect in my book. I'm not trying to capture lightning in a bottle here just see if it could...And yeah, I've looked at the stock history I know I bought in at a relative high for TTWO, but I've spent hours digging into it and I feel like is is worth tracking.
I love the enthusiasm, its cool seeing someone else who sees the potential too but don't let the FOMO eat you from the inside out. Just don't spend money you can't afford to lose, and I mean that for more than just stocks. That mindset can creep into anything and everything, man.
thanks for the tips, im new into trading. and have a few questions. Have you done news trading before, is it better than other strategies. I also know of Dollar Cost averaging. How do these two strategies compare and what should I use to get started with 5k. Thanks
RDR2 is such a superior investment play compared to GTA6 on the politics angle alone.  Don’t forget how divided our country is for a game that will most obviously involve race, gender, law, and crime.  This isn’t just a game anymore it’s an interactive movie and one that can fall flat compared to a western period piece that is mostly non-political.   Combined with the quality bar that gets raised even if Rockstar has a good track record in that regard past performance doesn’t dictate future performance.   Just like a game can come out and exceed expectations on small budget and dev team like Expedition 33, don’t kid yourself into thinking a AAA from the best of AAA developers can’t possibly face plant.
Yeah, I get that. I even expect it to be delayed again — the May 2026 date felt more like a soft placeholder anyway. And yeah, flop risk exists, but I don’t think it’s likely. That said, I’m not treating this like some sure-fire bet, that’s why I’m doing the 70/30 split before the title drops and pairing it with SONY since it’s more stable and not tied to just one game.  As for it being priced in... maybe partially. But the stock still reacted to both the trailer and the delay. If it was fully priced in, I don’t think we’d see that. I could very much be wrong,  I’m here to learn too but it doesn’t feel like a nothing-burger to me.
I'm going to assume that's a typo, as the stock price today is $236. That's a 3.51% increase since OP made the post. TTWO has been lagging behind all 3 major indices (S&P +10.6%, NASDAQ +16.3%, DJIA +8.96%). I'll check in later a year from now.  RemindMe! 1 year
GTA6 is going to be sweet. Tons of people are going to buy it. It’s all a question on how much of that is priced in at this point. With the launch expecting to have been sooner than it is now. I think a lot of it already has been 🤷🏻‍♂️ glad your expectations are tempered, that’s obviously wise.
Study Risk Management.  Read Mark Minervinies books.  Treat it like any other business.  It's hard and not a get rich quick thing.  You will lose money before making money, but if you stick with it you will learn how to make money.  It isn't a Golden ticket.  Like anything else in life it takes practice and heartache.
Ultimately your thesis is:  1) GTA releases on time  2) It is great or at least very good 3) the market hasn’t priced in 1 and 2  3 is where it falls down the most.  You don’t have any insight beyond the market in terms of what’s priced in and what isn’t.  At least it’s a thesis that could be quantified.

typo! let's check back when the game is released. lol that's when I will sell.
Yeah, I mean no question this game is going to sell like fucking hotcakes it’s just a matter of how it’s received, the quality, and how long it holds up. Rockstar’s got a rep for putting out high-caliber stuff, sure, but at the same time, the expectations for GTA VI are and will be sky-high. They’re basically being asked to top everything they’ve ever done, which is already a high bar.
Its pretty common for the general reddit sentiment to have the attitude that everything is price in if its considered common knowledge but if you look at old threads its so common that the stocks reddit says not to buy end up pumping. Yes, It's priced in to a degree but markets aren't fully efficient and a lot of what drives price is hype frankly. Look at stocks like tesla that are fully disconnected from true market value and run up based fully on speculation and hype.  GTA 6 hype is only going to increase and in my opinion it's more likely then not that the hype will drive up the price as it gets closer to the release date just like we saw happen with GTA 5 and when the most recent trailer dropped. Personally I'm going all in on TTWO. I'll still hold the stock post release of GTA 6 as I expect they will have massive revenue from online microtransactions. Even moreso then the huge sums gta 5 pulled in from shark cards
These are all  priced in the stock price already.  Don’t bother.
If you believe GTA6 will be released in May 2026, I got a bridge to sell you...
Already priced in my brother, you think this is the first the market has heard of GTA?  If anything it may dip on release because the expectations are so high.
2nd trailer, probably.
We're getting GTA VI stock tips before GTA VI...
Sell the hype
Well, I sold in after hours when I saw the delay. Lost a few bucks. Looks like I should’ve held a bit for it to bounce back.
Everyone's going the wrong direction in relation to GTA VI.  You guys don't think it's going to be a way more community based, im talking crypto adaption-implementation.   Jasmy is a crypto based company that's partnering with Playstation.  Jasmy will be utilized for transactions and information exchange.   You're welcome.
At all?
😭
Yes everyone expects the GTA VI release and everyone expects to do record sales. So the price already reflects that. On the other hand if something goes wrong, like a huge delay or a very buggy release this could get the price actually lower.
Don’t you know it was priced in 29 years ago. They expected this then. You gotta be at least 125 years ahead of the game /s
Sony won't make you rich, but it'll make you richer.
Fact, cheap stock to get tbf
Saying that it’s just Elden ring or Fromsoft is vastly underselling it.   It’s a pretty huge media company. It owns a lot of anime/manga publishing and studios and a lot more.  Sony is slowly cornering anime/manga market. And with how popular it is with the under 30 market and growing it could really pay off in the long run. I still think Sony buying Crunchyroll for a billion is going to be seen as a fantastic deal.
not a fan    more middle managers and VPs to answer to destroys creativity 
This deal is huge for Sony. They’re trying to monopolize the anime industry with their recent acquisition of Crunchyroll and Funimation. If this deal goes through, acquiring From Software is like the little cherry on top especially with Microsoft recently acquiring Zenimax and ActiBlizz
As a gamer, sad to see it. More Concord-style slop on the market is never a good thing.
well, all we can do is hope not
Thread made me look up Sony stock price to find out they did a stock split and I didnt even notice.
Doing rough napkin math; I'd say the acquisition price could be in the realm of ¥800B, which is some decent upside from the ¥500B market-cap it closed at. Lot of risk on this trade though, as with any acquisition, and I'm just pulling numbers out of my ass here.  Would kind of hope the deal falls through as I feel Sony would only enshitify Kadokawa's IP.
Woah
It's not From that sony is eyeing.  It's anime.
Fuck sony
Sony is barely making money with what they have so how is buying more going to make it better?  Sony thinks it is the competition that is hurting profits and not how they manage what they already have?
ugh I hate soul games don't buy it Sony, you are already in so much debt
Think Sony buying Kadokawa is going to kill the industry.
> vastly underselling it  > It’s a pretty huge media company  Pointing out that Kadokawa are larger than just FromSoftware is good, but people are going too far the opposite way, and are overselling how big Kadokawa is. Ultimately it has a lot of assets, but with a market cap of $3.2bn those assets are collectively not worth all that much.
I think Sony has a strong track record of maintaining core philosophies and principles of studios they acquire, at least from the game division.
God of war, Bloodborne, Horizon......
I guess the question is, does the Japanese government mind monopolies?
How will this lead to “concord-style slop”?
Depends on which part of Sony they'll be under, likely it'll be Sony Pictures or Sony Music. 
Using a big bag of money to acquire an already successful company with an established market is very different to trying to make a successful company from the ground up by acquiring successful people and putting them in a room together with a big bag of money.  They don’t automatically end up at the same place, and what Sony is doing here is a well trodden path to growing an already massive company.
I don't know, I played a little bit of Astro Bot and it didn't seem very Concord like to me. Maybe I have to play it more
Sony Eletronics don't make Concord Phones.
> could be in the realm of ¥800B, which is some decent upside from the ¥500B market-cap it closed at  That ¥500B is after Kadokawa popped 22% on this rumour, which is unlikely to be the baseline of any negotiation. Even so, ¥800B is a huge 60% premium on that. On yesterdays ¥409B price it's a 95% premium.  I don't think Sony would go for it on those valuations. More realistic it's ¥500B-¥600B
They don't really have a lot of debt.  They have a debt-equity ratio of 0.53, an A- credit rating, and are hitting record profits (and part of the reason they have a higher debt load is because of their financial services division, which requires a higher debt load than most sectors).

Fucking up helldizers, concord, killing tlou2 multiplayer.
It's because I just bought a PS5 a week ago. You're welcome lads 👍
Sony's crushing it right now. [Their gaming division profits nearly tripled to 138.8 billion yen](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sony-reports-healthy-profits-strong-085124323.html) and they're dominating in multiple sectors. PS5 sales are solid with 3.8M units this quarter. Their music division is booming thanks to streaming, and those image sensors are selling like crazy.  The Hollywood strikes hit their movie division, but that's temporary. What matters is they're still projecting 980B yen profit for the fiscal year. Strong fundamentals across gaming, music, and hardware.  The PS5 Pro launch is perfectly timed for the holiday season. Next year looks even better with Monster Hunter and GTA VI dropping. This isn't just a gaming play anymore - Sony's got their fingers in every entertainment pie that matters.
What yall think is a fair price for sony?
I'm still rocking the PS4. What do I do?
Congrats Sony shareowners!  Never owned the stock, but always admired the company products.
I had to exit the market a few years ago to pay for my wedding, and since then I've been saving for a house. This was one of the individual stocks I was holding and it looks like it would have been a very good pick looking at performance over the last few years!
Great numbers
What the, ps5 pro did numbers??
Sounds like someone is learning to write off these Marvel flops
I can't bring myself to buy a PS5 knowing that a PS6 is right around the corner... been saying that to myself every year... maybe I should just get one. Smh.
Share price increases 1% though, is that right?
watch you’ll hear “just announced, PS6!”
The interesting thing is that they kept Outlook, I wonder if they tested any other email clients, or they must have gotten a sweet deal with office 365
I would also like to point out that anime (Crunchyroll) continues to be a big money maker for Sony.
Minimum $100 presplit, for sure
Enjoy it if you're so inclined? Nothing wrong with that. Not sure exactly what you're asking, though, but you're certainly not alone, as a number of PS4 players have yet to transition to the PS5. However, I think they will continue to benefit from growth in the network services segment. PlayStation Network, including PS Plus service/ software sales count whether they're on PS4 or PS5.   From the Sony earnings report:  >PS Plus is providing a stable base of earnings as sales on a U.S. dollar basis increased 18% year-on-year. This is due to an increase in ARPU (average revenue per user)primarily resulting from a shift to higher tiers of service and the impact of price revisions.  This is with the PS5 sales (65.5 million)slightly lagging PS4 sales during the same time period by roughly 2.2 million units. PS5 Pro enthusiasm and holiday deals might help push things even further in the right direction, reducing that gap.
The ps5 pro just released yesterday.
Unlikely considering everybody thinks it's a piece of shit regarding price to value ratio.  However they have had banger games
+9%
It's $19 right now - or I am I looking at the wrong Sony?
$19.91, correct
Thanks. I own 30 shares. It’s been a dog but it’s an extreme value stock. If they were a US. Company with a pumper CEO like Huang or Musk it would be triple the price.
I’m sure this is good news for amd.
Huh so are amd’s gaming seg decline primarily Xbox based
Xbox lackluster sales while PS5 remains king
I like sony, but I don't think there's any incentives to buy a console anymore
You're still fighting the console wars?
Consoles are cheaper, simpler and more reliable.
Not sure about that, quite a niche viewpoint. General consumer isn't switching en masse to PC. Playstation make far more from their existing install base than they used to, all about that 20% cut from digital sales. This super slow moving 9th generation is just entrenching their dominance of the console market.
Yeah for Nintendo
And very importantly, decreased overheads from the transition to digital software. No more manufacturing, no more shipping, no more brick and mortar cut
How greed and incompetence eats a company. She doesn’t want to sell the company off for a fair price nor is she capable of appointing a good executive team to run the company. Fucking idiot, making me lose money.
Nobody feels bad for Shari. She is a totally unqualified moron who inherited the company and has contributed absolutely nothing of value. Gotta wonder what she’s gonna do now that she has fully nuked the stock price.
The market isn’t dealing with a normal person in Shari. She is Shiv Roy from Succession.  I think she likes the political power of owning CBS News.   Without ownership, she’s just another slightly wealthy older woman that no one will listen to or take seriously.   In addition, her ego and the need to prove her father wrong will continue to be damaging to Paramount.  I wish the staff good luck.
Oof, rough times over at Paramount.  Maybe they should've taken the deal when they had the chance. Could be a buying opportunity here though, gotta do some DD.
I’ll be curious to see if Paramount might drop out of the S&P500.
Most of the focus on the stock is on whether or not a deal will be made. A lot of investors this year bought in hoping that they can make a quick buy if Paramount gets sold off. Byron Allen offered $21.53 per class B share, The Apollo/Sony Offer was $26 Billion, or about $20 per share after debt is paid off, and the most recent Skydance offer was a $15 per share tender offer on about 50% of the shares. So the stock has hovered between $10 and $15 based on various leaks to the media about offers, negotiations, etc.  With many offers shot down by Shari Redstone, the most recent one being the Skydance offer, optimism for a deal is at record lows.  What also isn't helping is nearly every media outlet is releasing articles implying that the company is on the brink of collapse, even though the company's financials paint a completely different picture.  There is reason for optimism- Legacy TV, while it is slowly declining(about 1% YoY decline in subscription/affiliate revenue, and a cyclical downturn in advertising), it is still producing over $4.5 Billion in operating income per year, while the company's market cap is just $6.3 Billion. Direct To consumer, despite its tremendous growth, has been a money pit for the past 3 years, which is why the stock has tanked so hard, but is on track to become domestically profitable by 2025.  The stock isn't going to be the next Nvidia, the next Apple, etc. But it is a deep value play- with the actions they're taking to cut costs, aim for cashflow/profitability, and deleverage, I think the stock can easily double in the next 3 years and triple in 5 years.
The other week I made a topic asking if bottom was in then. Seems it was not. Averaged down my previous 13$ position to 11$. Will buy even more if hits 9 and then leave it till whenever it goes back to +15$
This is another example of why tiered/dual class stocks can be a disaster
I’m torn on this one, I refuse to buy falling knives but I love obvious takeover targets 
Lollll not me debating getting back in… 🧐
Value investors and their sum of the parts cases ("the IP!") vs majority shareholder who doesn't give a shit, lousy/overpaid CEO (now 3 co-CEOs - if the company did as bad as it did under one overpaid CEO, how about three?) and a horrible industry = predictable disappointment.
Here's how my thinking here has evolved:  22 Feb 2022: coming close to good value, but needs to bring debt down to below 12bio, wait  01 Mar 2023 - 17bio debt, 1bio net income, too much leverage, too much market cap, pass and no further interest.   01 Dec 2023 - redid valuation using analyst sales, NI, div. at this historic low P/S was very close to value a few weeks ago, but has since climbed away - revisit in 6m,   13 Jun 2024 - unprofitable with margins eroded, 20x ev/ebitda, 13x debt to ebitda, pass
Was public opinion similar about NFLX? Back when they exited DVD rentals and focused on streaming? Also, in 2022 their users dropped and so did stock price.. from $690 to $190.. Boy, what a mistake to shun NFLX in 2022.  Could PARA be in this situation right now? These companies are just one '*Squid Game*' release away from 3X-5X  jump in stock price.
Yeah its pretty crazy, she's pretty much the only one keeping the price down:  - Her mandate to Bob Bakish that he build a streaming service destroyed a tremendous amount of shareholder value. Rather than profiting off of licensing their shows to streaming services, they instead poured Billions into their own streaming service. So basically, for 5 years Paramount blew most of its cash flow on this streaming service that still hasn't attained profitability. Not only did it blow its cash flow, but it had to sell off some of its valuable real estate and lease it back just to fund this ambition.  - Paramount has multiple potential buyers willing to pay twice the current market price of the stock, but she keeps saying no.  - With the stock trading incredibly cheap relative to nearly every metric, and TV media still generating over $4 Billion in annual operating income, she has not pushed for stock buybacks.   - She rejected a $11 Billion offer for Paramount's film studio, even though the filmed entertainment division is a small portion of revenues, and usually unprofitable. The proceeds for this could've paid off most of the company's $14 Billion in debt, and bought back a huge portion of the $6.3 Billion in shares outstanding.  The best thing that could happen to Paramount would be her selling her NAI stake to someone more competent. Paramount is worth at least $20 a share, but the uncertainty associated with her mismanagement is what's keeping the price so low.  The only reason I'm bullish is because it's very clear that she's done trying to blow money on Streaming, and the company is actually focused on efficiency and cash flow now. There were a few misteps(why shut down Noggin instead of selling, why remove shows in the showtime merger and take content impairments?), but overall I think it's positive for shareholders.
The situation is a complete mess, as the price is showing.  Anyway I think that current valuation is appealing so I opened a very small position at 10.85$.
It is a midcap stock now. It does seem at risk due to marketcap if it isnt bought out.
It would be a deep value play without Shari involved but she’s such a moron I don’t see how it’s worth the risk
Good analysis.   !remindme 2 weeks
I was in for an M&A play at around 12.00 then I fell asleep and had a dream. In my dream I was staring at the order screen and it said *PARA 9.72*.   I woke up and instantly sold out taking a measly 2% profit. Well it's nearly at 9.72 now so maybe I'll give it a go again.
Looks like everyone overlooked Shari Redstone’s sheer will be a choosing beggar trying to save her family fortune and family legacy.   Looks like she’ll get both with this Skydance deal.   I don’t feel to good with this 50% dilution…
2023 was peak investment, of course margins eroded. Overall, the company has improved since 2022.   What screwed everything up was Shari Redstone willing to dilute all shareholders 50% in the Skydance merger so she could cash out, pay her NAI debts, and still keep the company intact.   Byron Allen’s offer is clearly superior, but Byron Allen has made it clear he would break up the company, which Shari Redstone does not want.   What a bitch
I don’t think Paramount + has the capacity for a hit show like that. Not enough people subscribe to the service, even if they were creatively able to achieve it.
And you can't even watch Paramount without ads! I pay for "ad-free" and their shitass product still shows me 45 seconds of "promotional material" at the start.
How does that 50% dilution feel?
> The best thing that could happen to Paramount would be her selling her NAI stake to someone more competent.   Yeah, the issue is her position is messy. The people who would want to buy it want to own the company, and buying a controlling stake like that will get them sued a bunch if they try to fully buy the company.
I know it looks ridiculously cheap. But it always has. Since 20 at least and not only has the shareholder value been cut in half since then but I've had something like 18 months of wasted opportunity cost on top of that too. Trust me, you don't want the life of a PARA shareholder. Never underestimate Shari Redstone's ability to destroy shareholder value.
Which currency has the dollar sign to the right of the figure?
I think there's good reason to believe that Shari might be out soon.   It's well known she's been exploring a sale. She's tried to sell her holding company National Amusements to Skydance, but Skydance wanted to merge with Paramount as a condition of the sale. Countless shareholders threatened to sue her over the merger, because they felt it hurt them, which scared her off, because Skydance wasn't willing to take all of the liability for lawsuits.   Edgar Bronfman and Steve Paul are each rumored to have their own offers for National Amusements. I think one of these deals are the most likely to happen. Unfortunately it likely won't result in a cash payout for Paramount shareholders, but it could mean new management with better ideas.
Bingo
So I want to say as a caveat that this stock is not a short term play, unless you're gambling on an acquisition/merger. If you are concerned about where it will be in 2 weeks, I would not recommend buying.  Momentum is working very hard against Paramount:  1. It's one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the S&P500 by percentage of float. With the threat of mergers fading, short sellers have been empowered to short sell like crazy.  2. Due to its low market cap, the stock could be removed from the S&P500, which could put further downwards pressure on price as indexes need to sell it off.  3. I think for the stock to reverse its long term trend, without a merger/ major asset sale, the company needs to report strong earnings with solid cash flows, and make progress on its balance sheet. Paramount's next earnings call isn't until August 5, and even then, I think it will take longer than that for them to really start fixing their cash flow.  It would not surprise me if in a week short sellers bring this stock down to $9. It's just where momentum is going. But I don't buy stuff based on momentum, I buy it based on value. And it can take years for share price to line up with intrinsic value

Same.   !remindme 2 weeks
NFLX 260M subscribers  Paramount (whole network) 700M  Paramount Plus 70M    Films and entertainment is so fickle.. hard to say, which Iron man, Superman or Stranger things stuff steals the subs. They say, even "Wednesday" helped NFLX gain a few million subs, whereas Baby Reindeer gave it a lawsuit! Really it's anyone's guess..
At a $10 valuation, 50% dilution isn't a huge deal considering there will also be a tender offer for $15 a share. So if you are able to wait a year through a M&A process, if it closes, new shareholders could make a solid return. That being said, it still seems like a breach of fiduciary duty considering there were better offers, so I do think long term shareholders should sue.  I ended up selling at $11.71 because I didn't like management's decision making and the clear conflict of interest in their M&A activities. The day to day drama wasn't good for my health. I was hoping to make more profit, but I settled for a small profit. I've pretty much switched to index investing so I can focus on other things in life than keeping up with stocks.
I'm europoor sorry

SONY stocks go UP!!
Alamo Drafthouse is such a dope theatre
There was a law preventing this until 2020. I wonder what happened around then.
They will show morbius around the clock at Alamo now
People are cheering now but this is exactly how we end up with concentration and monopolies and higher prices
G
Pour one out for the folks trying to unionize at the Alamos in Colorado
The best reason to go to Alamo Draft House and pay elevated prices for dinner and drinks while watching a movie was their No Disturbing rule. Talking, phone use, or excessive movement would get the distractor kicked out. It was a serious movie viewing experience. After COVID, they got lax and lost that value.
A theater (National Amusements) has a controlling stake in Paramount Global which is the parent company of Paramount Pictures.  You could argue it’s already very incestuous in Hollywood. Speaking of…House of Dragon is back this weekend!
Month later, All shutdown guess no one wants movies anymore
This sucks, Alamo is a great brand and Sony is not. Guess I'll see the fun factor sucked out of the chain in the coming years.
Lina khan gonna be all over this.  It’s a monopoly!
Now they can see for themselves, that business is a corpse sprinkled with stale popcorn.   The End
It’s probably going to break 90 this week.
[removed]
Isn't theater business doing poorly? Or does it only apply to a company like AMC?
COVID? That happened and crushed everything especially movie theaters. So whatever law was stopping a transaction like this was removed so they can get out of bankruptcy and continue to employ and operate their locations.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pictures,_Inc.
The law sunsetted and Trump didn’t renew it when the option came up to do so. 
society pocket makeshift tidy quiet tease butter somber carpenter unused
In the past this is how we ended up with the studios locking their content behind their own movie theaters and refusing to let any theaters they didn't own air their movies for at least 4 weeks at a minimum, after which there was way less value in showing the movies elsewhere.  It was an anti-competitive and anti-consumer choice practice that got the government to go after them.
> how we end up with concentration and monopolies and higher prices  Oh my, the market will face high prices at movie theaters and probably have to invest.....\*checks notes\*......$300 in a 55 inch 4K TV to get that same experience at home.  Oh, wait.   That already happened.   Like a decade ago.
Dallas folks are just hoping they reopen the locations that closed last week
No.  How we end up with monopolies and higher prices this that every legacy media company goes out of business, and bit tech streamers own all entertainment.
There’s like 40 Alamo drafthouses though. I can’t see it doing much besides a temp boost.   I guess there’s, you know, the implication.
Let's see
Hopefully I can liquidate my position then
This news came out around 2:30. At least give it a day to circulate and get into people's news feeds.
High end, full service theaters like Alamo might be experiencing different dynamics relative to basic ones like AMC.
A big part of why they do poorly is how much of a cut the studios take of ticket sales leaving theatres to rely on overpriced concessions. This removes that problem and means Sony gets 100 percent of the sales in these theatres for their movies plus concessions so potentially it might be more profitable.
Poor AMC 😂
the OP literally says Sony bought them in out of bankruptcy, which they declared in 2021 due to COVID...
And yet this is the first acquisition since then
The law was [permitted to sunset](https://deadline.com/2020/08/paramount-consent-decrees-justice-department-2-1203007221/) by [Judge Analisa Torres](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analisa_Torres) who was appointed by [President Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_judges_appointed_by_Barack_Obama)
It’s not just about news.. their earnings were good and stock tanks year till date yet. There’s plenty room for it to grow in coming weeks.
... I mean if the theaters are doing awful because the studios are taking most of the movie ticket money, then Sony would obviously be better off not owning the much less profitable theaters.
It was supported by a private equity firm before being acquired by Sony. This assistance helped them get back on their feet, at least.
How many people/organizations want to buy a business that is predicted to collapse. Everyone keeps saying that movie theaters are struggling and are struggling to stay afloat…. Aka bankruptcy for this movie theater chain.
Studios aren't exactly doing great since then. Streaming is bad business but Sony was smart to stay out and remain an arms dealer. This acquisition is probably easier for them than another studio whose plugging billions a quarter jnto streaming development.
That's because the business of running a movie theater is slowly bleeding out....which should tell you something about this deal....
What's your point?
The profit is in negotiating leverage with other theater chains, The split between movie theater and distributors is negotiated. Big movies like Marvel or Star Wars the distributor takes more like 90% of the ticket sales. Smaller films with less negotiating power can take closer to only 50%. It also gives them the ability to release smaller films that otherwise couldn't get wide releases. Sony doesn't have a streaming service. They can show classic Sony films as well, which has been a growing part of movie theaters strategy. They also get a bigger data set on movie goers habits. There is a lot of potential strategic advantages to vertical integration for Sony.

If you own ATVI shares, does anyone know how long it'll take for the shares to become cash?

So happy to see Bobby Kotick leaving. Great news for anyone playing Blizzard games.
hopefully CoD won't fucking suck anymore
Well at least it’s less than Disney & Fox’s deal
A simple 6% win for my shares is more than I was expecting.
here's hoping msft lets someone good run the company to reestablish some of its prestige. its been such a steady stream of disappointment to watch and play their games from all the way back to warcraft 3 to current day...  im not too optimistic but surely anything would be an improvement to the way they were running it before this.
Will the stockholders keep their stock in ActiBlizz as MST stock or did the shareholders just lose all of their shares?
[deleted]
I mean, WoW has generated just over $10 billion whilst CoD has generated over $20 billion so that makes sense, particularly because of its broader appeal and larger playerbase
The mobile games make more then WoW and CoD combined. The mobile is what MSFT really wanted.
My man, how are you going to act like the articles aren't bringing up the right thing yet you brought WoW instead of Candy Crush, which absolutely dominates everything else at ABK? Not trying to rag on you but even WoW isn't their biggest cash cow. I get why Microsoft is getting into mobile and wants to get a turnkey operation instead of banking on multiple risky games that take time to develop, mobile makes crazy revenue due to people buying into the F2P system. I own an Xbox and while that makes me a bit bias I think this was a really smart play by MS and it won't be as damaging to the industry as people say. By the time it would do anything I am sure there will be plenty of other things happening that will make this a non issue. Time will tell, though. Main point is, the fact that the articles are bringing up CoD and you brought up WoW means a lot of people really don't understand how much revenue MS just bought, it is really crazy and was absolutely worth the price. 70 billion is a huge number and it was heavily discounted
I actually wonder if Microsoft will pump more money into WoW to try to grow the playerbase and get more sub revenue.  Though I guess it's more likely that WoW will just become part of a higher-priced, more premium subscription package.
Because CoD is the bigger brand and generates more revenue
Or candy crush
Schwab processed mine today.
I had access to them today through fidelity, they haven't settled yet of course, though.
Today or early next week depending on your brokerage.
Nice.
Based on the article, MSFT is buying back the Activision stock out there at $95 a share. So owners of Activision stock will end up with cash.
Already have the $95 cash per share. Should've loaded up friday with my loose cash.
No.  And no one 'loses' their shares.  They will get cashed out .
Agree. Gaming is huge and will continue to grow across all platforms. This deal will be accretive for MS shareholders. Nadella has done a great job making MS 'cool' again. It remains to be seen if they can get any traction with Bing.
[removed]
LOL.   Nobody mentions the gold farmers that melts WOW a thing.
[deleted]
COD is bigger cause a better fantasy brand has not come Along.    Hasbro will crush.
Awesome. I've never owned a buyout stock like this. Wasn't sure if it took a while to close or not.
Nice
So they will get cash and still keep the shares?
Yep, a lot of people really don't understand how good of a deal this was for MS. CoD, Wow, and CC alone will bring them a lot of revenue and they got ABK at a heavily discounted price. I get people want to be upset but there just really wasn't ever legit arguments against it other than people screeching "MoNoPoLy" without even knowing what that means. This is one of the smartest business moves recently, and probably *the* smartest in the gaming industry so far
Wait candy crush is part of the deal??  Holy shit.  MSFT going to print money even more.
[deleted]
Also at Schwab and got the cash today. In my transaction history, it looks like the purchase should officially close on the 16th. If you don't have the money by then, call your broker.
My experience using IBKR was as follows.   It was spac and I had the option of either converting my shares or selling them at a predetermined price and date. At the date it just happened.      I know it isnt the exact same, but it might be useful to know for someone.
Nice.
No man.  No one gives you free money.  Your shares get converted to cash.  If you had bought 100 shares, you will see the 100 shares sold with $9500 in cash coming back to you.  Your profit is the difference of what you bought vs selling at $95.
[removed]
Yup. And the smartest in media was Disney buying SW for just $4B.
Can you elaborate on what exactly makes this a brilliant acquisition? Simply owning CoD is the smartest business move in history?
Wow moving to AI will be huge.   Pokémon moving to AI will be huge.   Toss in augmented reality.   Shit gonna get real.     Pun intended
Most profitable because they are the most predatory with MTX
Nice.
That was what I was askin. Ty for answering.
The more profit driven it becomes, the worse it becomes. More incentive for micro transactions and battle passes. All the best game devs are non public companies that dont need to constantly appease shareholders.
Figured I would expand on that. King is obviously just doing fantastic but I think MS will look to expand their scope on the mobile platform so they can make more money. Activision has needed a culture shift for a long time so that is fairly obvious MS is going to shake things up there. Blizzard could definitely use improvement, if not as bad as Acitivion, and I am certain MS will want to be doing stuff with Diablo, OW, and WoW. Working at any of those places is about to be crazy
We need the AoE dev teams working on blizzard games.
Honestly I think we will see a change in all three parts
For real, looking back it is really insane how cheap that was, so much revenue
Well if you actually read my comment it isn't simply owning CoD (never said, I put the opposite actually it is about the massive amounts of revenue generated by Candy Crush, followed by Wow and Cod and Overwatch. Then you have all their other IPs to booty. They are going to be making crazy revenue off this deal fast which is known as a smart business move. No one is saying it is brilliant, it was just a very good strategic purchase that will bring back that money they spent
Yes, but the best will eventually be absorbed into the giants
All the best rts devs are now working in different studios like frostgiant. But honestly we already have broodwar, nothing will ever be superior.
Ah okay. Thanks! Sorry didn't mean to put words in your mouth, was genuinely curious -- I could've worded it better 🙏  I do wonder at the potential for Blizzard IP...I thought WoW was on a downhill, and OW didn't do well with their OW2 release. D4 didn't seem to keep many players soon after launch either
WoW has been on the downhill for 10 years.... That's just the community being so big (I'm sure WoW has a similar stat to like 1 in 10 people have worked at mcdonalds in the US. 1 in 10 have probably played wow.) and people not agreeing with the direction. It's still alive and healthy. Just not at it's peak which was unprecedented (12ish million subs at 15/month) Still very successful for the MMO space. D3 was a flop at launch too that is just the MO of blizzard lately. D4 will turn around in a year or two most likely when they give it the D3 treatment. OW2 release was just disappointing but the game is active as it ever was so wouldn't say it didn't do well just didn't make it any better.
Wow needs a competitor that has a better system
FFXIV :)

Honestly surprised  I thought the yen would really mess up Sony this quarter
Then Sony is supposed to fall then.
im surprised the concord flop didn't hurt their guidance.

Corporate boss doesn't like unions? Shocking.
Goddamn unions eating into profitability.... Quick, fire people to compensate
in other news - ceos and execs get richer and crews can’t have health insurance or wages that keep up with inflation. us entertainment industry is fucked to high hell
I remember during pandemic some people were calling for software devs to unionize, to which they arrogantly laughed at them saying they could find job easily if needed. Look at how times changed.

Whatever happened to that fake ass Apex Capital monster bid? lmao Hope someone gets charged over that absolute nonsense.  Social media is ruining the world.
Smart
Look what happened to the stock after the first deal was announced. Right before the split that could be brutal
I saw a comment on Reddit it was fake.  They debunked it by looking up the company.  Also if it was real. Faber report would have been all over it.
This is the first time I've heard about that, so I had to check for [news](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/apex-capital-trust-submits-bid-acquire-paramount-global-up-43-bln-2024-07-31/) about it. Lol
